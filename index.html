                <p>We would only launch tokens with the express permission of the creators. </p>
                <p>There are several thousand celebrities and creators on twitter, tiktok, Instagram and YouTube with
                    followings in the millions who we would be actively engaging before we go viral.

                    We would get them on our
                    platform and they would see the opportunity to create a fan driven digital economy where their
                    digital
                    content can be traded as NFTs and their most loyal fans can have the monetary value of their
                    creator's
                    currency increase significantly as they promote their digital currency across their channels while
                    our

            <h3>Tokners is Coming</h3>
            <p id="textualuri">
                <span class="importanttext">Cryptocurrency adoption is at less than 1% of the global world population
                    with some countries
                    and entities actively fighting against its mass adoption and the smartest developers and nerds
                    holding the fort.</span>

                Bitcoin was the first, and it has since grown to thousands of tokens launched all
                aiming to fix one problem or the other with some quite simply FOMOing the moment. Our goal is
                to bring mass adoption to the cryptocurrency space by dumbing it down. How far down? So
                down that even a celebrity can explain it in simple words to their followers and have them
                download an app, buy into the social currency of their favourite person and watch their
                investment as is with other cryptocurrency project.

                We are trying to do to this space what
                investment apps did for the "nonexistent retail investors". We are gamefying digital currency,
                bringing in popular faces instead of hard to understand projects to make it the norm and inadvertently
                being the "gateway drug" for a lot of people to finally give this space a real look.
                <span class="importanttext">A new digital economy is coming. People would be just as powerful as
                    countries and creators
                    would be paid beyond the peanuts that conventional social media platforms can offer.</span>

                There
                would be new markets and advertisers with little to offer would not find home there. Like Kanye
                said, "Personalities would become the new currency, and services would be built on top of them".
                Well, Kanye didn't exactly say that, but it sounds like something we hope he would say.

                Currency is digital, it has been that way for a while now, but this time there would be no dead
                presidents on the money, there would people like you on the money, and you would own it
                because it would make the most sense in the world.
